# Cart-Pole
Reinforcement learning project utilizing NEAT and Deep Q learning techniques

A project designed to compare the neural evolution of augmenting topography (NEAT) and deep Q learning reinforcement AI architectures on the simple pole balancing problem from gym.openai.com. Results show that the NEAT model was able to achieve better performance in fewer iterations while also maintaining a faster runtime. A full write up of the project and results can be found in the PDF. Project was completed in December 2019 for CS 518 Advanced Analysis of Algorithms at Washington State University - Vancouver.
